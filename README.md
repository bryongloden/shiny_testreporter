# Shiny_testreporter

This Shiny app anlyzes two types of data: 1) end of semester assessment of students in the form of their course grades, teacher evaluations, and final assessment scores, and 2) student responses to their reading, listening, speaking, and writing tasks from their final assessments

The goal is to develop method of systematic and flexible analysis of how we evaluate our students. All of the data is mock data. A working version of this app can be found at https://laflair.shinyapps.io/shiny_testreporter

Many thanks to Dean Attali for his Persistent Data Storage application and and article about persistent data storage for the design of this application and for introducing me to the number of possibilities for data management that interfaces with Shiny.

This app is currently under development, and can be demoed at https://laflair.shinyapps.io/shiny_testreporter/. The next updates will include criterion-referenced test analysis measures.
